# Pexels Image Search App

## Why I Used Pexels API  
Initially, I wanted to use the Flickr API, but it required a Pro account for API access, and I couldn't do that cuz im bRoKe.  
So, I chose **Pexels API** instead because it provides free access to high-quality images without restrictions.

## How It Works  
- Enter a search term (e.g., "mountains" or "dogs").
- The app fetches images from Pexels using `HTTParty`.
- It displays up to 10 images related to the search.

## Future Improvements  
- Implement secure API key storage.
- Add more UI enhancements.

## Installation  
1. Clone this repo:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/pexels-search-app.git
   cd pexels-search-app
